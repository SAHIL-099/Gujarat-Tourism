 An ancient tale of separation, the Rukhmini Devi Temple is located about 1.5 km from the Dwarka city centre. This 12th-century remnant carries out some evident architectural marvels of the time through its mural carvings and other structures.
 The Hindu mythical story behind this temple begins with Rukhmini Devi and her husband Lord Krishna, picking up the sage Durvesha for dinner. On the way, Rukhmini Devi stopped to quench her thirst at the Ganges, with the help of her husband.
 Known to be short-tempered, Durvesha Muni was quite enraged when she did not offer him any water. Thus he summoned Rukhmini Devi to be separated from Lord Krishna. Therefore, her temple lies at the outskirts, while Lord Krishna's temple is within the Dwarka city.

<h4>Gopi Talav | Among the Best Tourist Places in Dwarka</h4>

 A legendary lake in Gujarat, Gopi Talav is located in Dwarka. Legend has it that this lake used to be the childhood memory of Lord Krishna where he used to perform the dance of "raas' for his female admirers, also known as Gopis.
 It is said that in a fit of restlessness from staying away from Krishna, the Gopis from Vrindavan arrived to dance with him one last time. Thus they offered to give up their lives and merge with the soil during this dance of divinity.
 Today, the soil is famously known as the "Gopi Chandan", or the sandalwood of the Gopis. Gopi Talav hones this soft yellowish soil, marking the mythical event of the Gopis of Vrindavan and Lord Krishna.
