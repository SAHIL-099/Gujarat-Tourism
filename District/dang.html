    <h4>Sunrise and sunset point | Among the Best Tourist Places in Dang</h4>

    <div class="text">
        Just next to Malegaon there is a spot which is known as a spot to cherish the beauty of Sunrise and is known as
        the Sunrise point or Valley view point.

        You can enjoy the lush greenery around the spot and the cool breeze which retreats your soul and relaxes it.
        Similarly on the western side, we have Sunset point which gives a great view of Dang forest, filled with
        enormous greenery and a magnificent view as the Yellow colored sun imperceptibly strewing redness on the
        skyline.
        There is a lot of climbing that is needed to reach to this point though and it is recommended that you carry a
        water bottle along. However you can also choose to get into The Ropeway, a cable car service which takes 15
        minutes to reach the sunset point and gives an exquisite bird's eye view of Satpura. Ticket for the same is for
        Rs. 40 per head and it does not start until it has enough passengers boarded.

        Tucked in between the Sahyadri ranges, lies this conserved wildlife park spanning over an area of about 24 sq
        kilometres. It got its name as Vansda because it was once privately owned by the Maharaja of Vansda. Not a
        single tree has been cut since then. Owing to this, in some places, the canopies are so thick that sunlight does
        not pass through. It is an open park, and you can easily get a permit if you want to explore it in your own
        vehicle.
        It is situated in the Navsari district of Gujarat and is a 110-minute drive from Vansda town. Vansda, the park
        is the principal trading place for the village of Vansda and its surrounding area, which are inhabited by
        tribes, commonly known as Adivasis. The park is very close to Waghai town which forms an entry point for the
        Dang jungles. A botanist's and wildlife enthusiast's paradise, the place is home to over hundreds of different
        and unique varieties of flora and fauna. River Ambika flows along its north-eastern boundary, and a major part
