    <h4>Jami Masjid | Among the Best Tourist Places in Panchmahal</h4>

    <div class="text">
        Jami Masjid, also known as Jama Masjid of Champaner is located about 150 feet (46 m) east of the city walls.
        Dating back to the 15th century, it is widely considered as one of the finest mosques in western India.
        Along with modern techniques of architecture, this mosque also reflects how the architects used modern
        techniques to cultivate rainwater harvesting systems. One of the minarets is a tad bit damaged. This is not
        because it has been worn out but because of an intentional gun firing in 1812 by a Scindia Governor named
        Patankar. The monument has some very majestic artwork on its symmetric pillars and all this has been conserved
        very well.

        Kevada Masjid was constructed amid a lot of greenery and open spaces, which is not the most common thing in
        Islam. The most interesting part about this mosque is its mausoleum and the globe shaped domes.
        The entrance of the Kevada Masjid is also flanked by two tall minarets. It was built under the regime of Mahmud
        Begada during the 15th century. It is worth giving a visit, due to the highly unusual location of the monument

    <h4>Lakulisa temple | Among the Best Tourist Places in Panchmahal</h4>

    <div class="text">
        Lakulisa temple sits calmly atop the Pavagadh hill. This temple dates back to the 10th century and was
        constructed by Lakulisa, who was the founder of Pashupata Shaivism which was one of the oldest and prominent
        Shaivite schools.
        Lakulisa temple mainly lies in ruins now, one can notice how the intricate sculptures of Dakshinamurthy Shiva,
        Ganesha and Gajantaka Shiva are very prominent in this temple. Most of the upper half of the temple has fallen
        off, though what remains back of this ancient temple still gives one an idea of the exquisite Hindu
        architectural techniques.
