<h4>Koteshwar | Among the Best Tourist Places in Banaskantha</h4><br>

<div class="text">

The small village island of Koteshwar in the west of the Kutch district of Gujarat is famous for its religious significance as it houses an ancient Shiva temple and the important pilgrimage site of Narayan Sarovar, one of the five sacred lakes mentioned in the Hindu mythology. The shrine here is said to be another form of Shiva (Bhairava â€“ his fierce manifestation) of Hinglaj Mata at Hinglaj, a pilgrimage site in Balochistan, Pakistan, about 250 kilometres from Karachi. The area is known for providing picturesque sunsets overlooking the sea.
Legends and stories carried by generations over centuries have girdled and identified this place with utmost importance. Koteshwar translates to 'ten million gods'. A single road connects the mainland with the area which in the past was cut off because of rising tidal creeks. The Koteshwar Mahadev temple is the main attraction, overlooking the blue of the vast Arabian Sea and the waters of Kori Creek. The clashing landscapes of the sparsely inhabited Rann of Kutch on one side and the strikingly calm waters of the sea on the other, remarkably complement each other.
It is located on the westernmost inhabited outpost of the Indian subcontinent and is the only point of construction between the two sceneries, the calm sea and the deserted terrain. It is said that there were thrice as many as the temple structures that are standing here today. Built entirely by sandstone, the temple complex is an astonishing one with beautifully carved large domes, figurines of Hindu deities and captivating shrines.</p>
