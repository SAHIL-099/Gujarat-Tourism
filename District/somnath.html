        The Somnath temple located in Prabhas Patan near Veraval in Saurashtra on the western coast of Gujarat, is
        believed to be the first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. It is an important pilgrimage and
        tourist spot of Gujarat.Reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by several Muslim
        invaders and Portuguese the present temple was reconstructed in Chaulukya style of Hindu temple architecture and
        completed in May 1951. The reconstruction was completed by Vallabhbhai Patel. The site of Somnath has been a
        pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a Triveni sangam (the confluence of three rivers —
        Kapila, Hiran and Sarasvati. SomaMoon god, is believed to have lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in
        the Sarasvati River at this site to regain it. The result is the waxing and waning of the moon, no doubt an
        allusion to the waxing and waning of the tides at this sea shore location. The name of the town Prabhas, meaning
        lustre, as well as the alternative names Someshvar and Somnath (“The lord of the moon” or “the moon god”) arise
        from this tradition.

        is connected to both cities. There is an ancient temple of Lord Vishnu-Lord Shyam. Legend says that Lord Krishna

        stone.
