    <h4>Ranki vav | Among the Best Tourist Places in Patan</h4>
    <div class="text">
        Rani ki Vav was built by Rani Udayamati in memory of her husband Bhimdev I (1022 - 1063 AD) of the Solanki
        dynasty. The construction started around 1050 AD and was probably completed by Udayamati and Karandev I after
        the death of her husband. One can find the reference of Udayamati building the monument in the 'Prabandha
        Chintamani' composed by Merunga Suri in 1304 AD. The vav was later flooded by the nearby Saraswati River and
        silted over until the late 1980s, when it was excavated by the Archeological Survey of India, with the carvings
        found in pristine condition. Today, Rani Ki Vav is amongst the best step-wells in India, and one of the most
        famous legacies of the ancient capital city of Gujarat. It was added to the list of UNESCO's World Heritage
        Sites in 2014 and also bagged the title of 'Cleanest Iconic Place' in India at the Indian Sanitation Conference
        2016 in New Delhi.
        Rani ki Vav was built in the complex Maru-Gurjara architectural style, and is one of the must-visit Patan places
        to visit. Designed as an inverted temple highlighting the sanctity of water, it is divided into seven levels of
        stairs with more than 500 principle sculptures and over a thousand minor ones combine with religious,
        mythological, and secular images. This magnificent east-facing step well measures approximately 64 m long, 20 m
        wide & 27 m deep. Every surface of the well and levels are adorned with fine sculptures of Hindu deities
        including those of Ganesh on the lower levels, preceded by those of Vishnu, Laxmi-Narayan, Uma-Mahesh, etc. The
        most imposing imagery is Lord Vishnu reclining on the thousand-hooded serpent Shesha at the water level of the
        Rani ki Vav.
        During the month of December or January, a Rani ki Vav festival is held where one can enjoy the cultural
        programs along with exquisite local cuisine and street shopping.

    <h4>Sahastralinga Talav/Lake | Among the Best Tourist Places in Patan</h4>
    <div class="text">
        At a distance of 1 km from Rani ki Vav and 5 km from Patan Railway Station, Sahastralinga Talav is a medieval
        water tank located in Patan, Gujarat. Maintained by Archaeological Survey of India, it is one of the prominent
        places of heritage in Gujarat and among the top places to visit in Patan.
        Sahasralinga Talav, meaning 'lake of a thousand lingams', was built in 1084 by Siddhraj Jaisinh over a lake
        originally known as Durlabh Sarovar, built by the King of Durlabhray. This tank is situated on the north-western
        part of Patan, on the banks of the Saraswati River. The water tank, which is now dry, is known to have been
        cursed by a woman named Jasma Oden, who refused to marry Siddhraj Jaisinh and committed Sati to protect her
        honor.
        The Sahastralinga Talav is pentagonal in shape and marked by a series of mounds showing its shape. The talav is
        about 1 km broad and spans over an area of about 17 hectares. At its fullest, the talav would have contained
        about 4,206,500 cubic meters of water. In the center of the Talav is a large earth heap, the Bakasthana. On a
        raised platform over it, was built a rauza, an octagonal structure of Lakhori bricks. The most interesting of
        the relics are the channels, the well, steps and side elevation of the Talav, and a bridge. There is a finely
        carved three-ringed sluice gate that channeled water from the Saraswati River into the reservoir, and it is said
        that the lake had inbuilt natural filtration. About thousands of shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva were
        constructed on the edge of the water tank, but now there are remains of only some shrines.

    <h3>3.Patan Patola Heritage Museum</h3>

    <h4>Patan Patola Heritage Museum | Among the Best Tourist Places in Patan</h4>
    <div class="text">
        At a distance of 1 km from Rani ki Vav and 3 km from Patan Railway Station, Patan Patola Heritage is a small
        private museum located in Patan, Gujarat. Situated near Patan City Museum, it is one of its kind in the world
        and among the best places of sightseeing in Patan.<br> <br>
        Run by the award-winning Salvi family, Patan Patola Heritage Museum came into existence in 2014. Over 3,000 sq.
        ft of space and three floors, it documents the history of the Patan Patola, a textile that combines techniques
        of tyeing, dyeing, and weaving. Worn by royals and aristocrats on auspicious occasions, and prized as a holy
        cloth even in Southeast Asia, the Patola finds mention in the 14th century travel accounts of Ibn Batuta, who
        gifted Patolas to kings. These sarees were also mentioned in the 'Kalpsutra', a 2000-year-old Jain holy
        book.
        This museum is an excellent place to see Patola silk weaving in action as part of Patan tour. It is the
        house-cum-studio-workshop of a family of master-weavers called the Salvis. The family has specialized in
        double-ikat weaving since the 11th century over roughly 35 generations. The museum showcases the live
        demonstration of a Patola saree being woven, get an understanding of the process, photographs of celebrities
        wearing the Patan Patola, old vegetable dyes, old saris woven by the family, a 200-year-old red Patola frock for
        a child, Ikat artifacts from other countries, the Salvi family history, and also numerous national awards that
        the family has won.
        The making of Patan Patola sarees is extremely laborious and requires anywhere between five months to one year
        to create a single saree. Four to five family members work in unison, delicately weaving the unique creation.
        Another feature of these hand-dyed patolas which makes them stand out is that the feel and look of the fabric
        are exactly the same from both sides. In the 1930s, the Patola saree costs Rs. 120. Today, the simpler versions
        of double Ikat saree start from 20,000 and go up to several lakhs depending on the work done and thread
        used.

    <h4>Bindu Sarovar | Among the Best Tourist Places in Patan</h4>
    <div class="text">
        Bindu Sarovar simply means a lake of drops. It is believed that Lord Mahavishnu's tears have fallen in this
        lake. Also known as Matru Gaya Kshetra, Bindu Sarovar is one among the five sacred theerthas of Hindu religion -
        Pancha Sarovar. The other four are Manas Sarovar in Tibet, Pushkar Sarovar in Rajasthan, Narayana Sarovar in
        Gujarat and Pampa Sarovar in Karnataka. Hindus normally go to Gaya in Bihar to offer pinda to their male
        ancestors but Bindu Sarovar is the only place in India where Matru Shradh is being carried out. It is also known
        as the Sri-sthal or a 'pious place' and finds a reference in the ancient Vedic text the Rig-Veda.
        According to legend, Bindu Sarovar is the place where Sage Kardhama did severe penance for 10000 divine years
        and had the darshan of Lord Vishnu. It was on the banks of River Saraswati at this Bindu Sarovar, Sage Kapila
        had preached Moksha Gnana to his Mother Devhuti and performed the Matru Shradh of his mother salvation. It is
        said that at Bindu Sarovar Lord Parshuram also performed 'Matru Shradh' and his temple is also created here for
        darshan. Hence, Bindu Sarovar is considered as holy as Triveni Sangam at Allahabad.
        One can also visit two protected monuments in this town under the Archaeological Survey of India. They are Ruins
        of Rudra Mahalay temple and Jami Masjid. The Rudra Mahalay Temple was built in the 12th century by Siddhraj. The
        temple is an architectural wonder with a three-storeyed 'shikhara', 1600 pillars, 12 entrance doors, central
        mandap and porches in four directions. Around the temple, there were 11 shrines of Rudra. The eastern gate was
        adorned with beautifully carved 'Toran', with a flight of steps leading to the Saraswati River. The
        ornamentation of the temple was exuberant as shown by the elaborate and detailed carvings of the pillars and the
        beautiful Toran, which are the only remains of the temple today. Also, the town of Siddhpur is known for its
        mansions and havelis largely belonging to the Dawoodi Bohra community.
